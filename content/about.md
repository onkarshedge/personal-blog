I am an Application Developer at ThoughtWorks. I hold an Undergraduate degree in CS from Pune Institute of Computer Technology batch of 2016.
At ThoughtWorks, I have learnt XP practices, Clean Code, TDD, collaborating with clients, BAs to understand business process and come up with the best fit solution.
I have mostly worked on backend technologies, occasionally written few web components.
I am interested in Distributed systems, DDD and devops.

What is currently keeping me awake at night is "Have I designed Aggregates effectively in my project ?."
